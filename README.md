# Simple-encryption
Both files has the same goal: encryptions using simple XOR operator....and 
the last one is about substitution of characters

*Encrypt_file.py --> encrypt any files using XOR operator with a password.
*Encrypt_msg.py --> encrypt any msgs, words, texts using the same XOR with a password 
*Encryp_substi.py -->encrypt a msg by substitution of letters,numbers,symbol(characters)....
